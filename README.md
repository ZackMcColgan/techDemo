Engineering Exercise 
Anomaly Detection - IP Blocking 

Author: Zack McColgan

First iteration of a HTTP service that can determine whether a given IP address is allowed or blocked by this source: https://iplists.firehol.org/files/. 
If the IP is determined to be blocked, helpful information will be returned with the response, such as the source (the list that has the IP blocked) and other metadata.

API Documentation:
GET server:port/{ip}
Finds whether an IP address is allowed or blocked

Return:
If the IP is blocked: 
Sample Response:
[
    {
        "blocklist": "firehol_level2.netset",
        "ip": "119.92.186.19"
    }
]
Status Code: 200

If the IP is not blocked:
Status Code: 200
Sample Response: "IP not found in BlockLists"
